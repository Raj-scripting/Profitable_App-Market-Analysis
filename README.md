# 📱 Profitable App Profiles – App Store vs Google Play

This project analyzes mobile app data from the App Store and Google Play to identify app profiles that are likely to be profitable. The goal is to help developers make data-driven decisions about what kind of app to build.

## 📌 Project Summary

- Cleaned and explored two datasets: `Apple Store` and `Google Play Store`
- Removed duplicate and irrelevant entries
- Analyzed app categories by:
  - Frequency of appearance
  - Average number of installs (Google Play)
  - Average number of user ratings (App Store)
- Recommended a profitable app idea based on data insights

## 🔍 Key Insight

A **book-based app** with engaging features—like daily quotes, an audio version, quizzes, or discussion forums—could be profitable in both stores. While games dominate downloads, niche categories like "Books & Reference" or "Education" offer strong potential with less competition.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
